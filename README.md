# Fashion_Website
 A simple intuitive website that pushes the contemporary bounds of fashion advertisement
 
 Dharka (Clothes in Somali) is a brand new men’s fashion brand, seeking to reach the forgotten man. Designed in London and stitched in Pakistan, we are inviting our customers to join us on this exciting journey of building the brand together. Our unrivaled quality mixed with modern minimalistic yet unique casual look will undoubtedly please the masses.

This project consists of the following:

- 1.Creation of a shopify store (minimalistic yet chic looking page)
- modern clothing shopify shop similar to https://uk.representclo.com/pages/prestige and https://axelarigato.com/gb , the shopify site should have sections such as new arrivals, season (winter, spring, summer autumn), Special(VIP section only invited customers), Blogs, Rewards Programme signup, multiple language translation. A key feature is for a short cut section where users can navigate quickly to their type of clothing. Please please please research the website links i have provided. The only entries that will be considered will be those who demonstrate an attention to detail of the points mentioned.

- All popular payment options to be included such GooglePay, ApplePay, Paypal etc

- 2. Creation of 3 suspense building videos for social media 1) countdown with the logo glitch 2) logo glitch with coming soon and website details 3) logo glitch over a short background video of the clothes factory and 3 poster images with bold graphic design (ie electric mountain, digitalised desert), (raw video and logos supplied)

I’d like the above items to be complete with 5 working days, with significant direction and creative assistance given by myself. The assigned to this project will likely be retained for further marketting campaigns.
